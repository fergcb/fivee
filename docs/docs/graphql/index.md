# GraphQL API

Fivee's GraphQL API can be used to fetch data from the database using flexible queries.

The GraphQL API is probably what you want to use if you're building a tool that will utilise D&D data programmatically, such as an encounter generator, a character builder, or even a VTT. If you just need to embed D&D data into an existing web page, without writing much code, consider using the [Snippets API](/snippets) instead.

## Getting Started

To get started with the GraphQL API, you can visit the Apollo Sandbox Explorer and provide the URL https://fivee.co/graphql. Here, you will find all of the schemas and documentation you need to start building queries and fetching data from the API.

Once you've built your query, you can use any GraphQL client to start fetching data in your programming language of choice.
