      **Dousing a Space.** You can take the Utilize action to pour an Oil flask on level ground to
      cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of
      the turn 2 rounds from when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage to any
      creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only
      once per turn.

      **Fuel.** Oil serves as fuel for Lamps and Lanterns. Once lit, a flask of Oil burns for 6
      hours in a Lamp or Lantern. That duration doesn't need to be consecutive; you can extinguish
      the burning Oil (as a Utilize action) and rekindle it again until it has burned for a total of
      6 hours.
